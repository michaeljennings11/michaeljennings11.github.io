      <p>THIS PAGE IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION.</p>
			<p>Transitioning from lecture based academic courses into research for the first time can be difficult for some. The learning curve is quite steep for most students because the skills that facilitate successful research are not explicitly taught in undergraduate courses. Here I suggest tips and skills I have picked up along the way of starting Astrophysics research that I wish I knew about when first starting out.

      <h3 id="research_topic">Reference Organizer</h3>
      <p>Lecture based academic courses taken as an undergraduate usually use no more than one or two textbooks as references for the material. When first starting research, students have a lot of "catching up" to do in regards to familiarizing themselves with the subfield of interest. It is common to be given the first task of reading classic and recent literature when starting a new project with a research mentor. As time goes on, the amount of papers to read or to reference in your publication can become very large. I've noticed beginner students tend to download the pdf's of the neccessary papers and have all the files stored in a directory on their computer. Reference organization in this manner becomes unwieldy fairly quickly for these reasons: (1) you cannot easily search for keywords across the whole directory; (2) organizing papers by different projects is more difficult; (3) there are no convenient tools for creating citations for a project paper.
			</p>

      <p>For these reasons I recommend <a id="body-link" href="https://www.mendeley.com/homepage-2-1?interaction_required=true&adobe_mc_sdid=SDID%3D1EFF27C60CBB048B-7D6F1B1D9F107419%7CMCORGID%3D4D6368F454EC41940A4C98A6%40AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1604819628" target="_blank">Mendeley</a> to organize all references and to easily create citations for papers.
      </p> 
      
      <h3 id="research_topic">Text Editor</h3>
			<p>I recommend <a id="body-link" href="https://www.vim.org" target="_blank">vim</a> as a text editor.
			</p>

      <h3 id="research_topic">Version Control</h3>
			<p>I recommend <a id="body-link" href="https://git-scm.com" target="_blank">git</a> with <a id="body-link" href="https://git-scm.com" target="_blank">github</a> for a version control system.
